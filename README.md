# Heartrisk-Detection-CLIPS

CLIPS stands for C Language Integrated Production System. It is a tool to define expert systems and is a nonprocedural, declarative, and rule-based programming language.

Heart Risk Detection System is a system created to indicate the level of risk the user is at after asking questions about their health conditions such as:
1. Their gender
2. Their age
3. Are they obese?
4. Do they have high/low blood pressure issue?
5. Do they have diabetes?
6. What is their cholesterol level?
7. What are their HDL and LDL levels


**LOGIC:**

1. We calculate the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-
For female and male some standard ratio has been provided and according to that they fall under three categories: 
Low, Moderate and High risk of heart disease
2. If the answer to questions of obesity, high/low bp, and diabetes come as a yes, then the person might be at moderate to high risk of heart disease
3. LDL level must be within the range or else the risk would be moderate to high
